                <h2>Heritage Town of Taal</h2>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Taal is a historic municipality in the province of Batangas, Philippines. Known as the "Heritage Town of Taal".</p>

                <p><strong>History:</strong> The town of Taal was founded by Augustinian friars in 1572. In 1575, the town transferred later to the edge of Domingo Lake (now Taal Lake) in 1575. In 1732, it became the provincial capital of Batangas. In 1754, Taal Volcano erupted, endangering the town of Taal which stood at present-day San Nicolas. Threatened by the new danger, the townspeople, together with the Augustinian Francisco Benchucillo, sought refuge in the sanctuary of Caysasay. The provincial capital was also transferred to the then-town of Batangas in the same year.</p>

                <p><strong>Why I love this place:</strong> Nothing beats home. Other than it being my home town, the atmosphere and vibe that I get whenever I come back makes me very relaxed and at peace. It also shows a very important time and place in our culture as big metropolises and cities starts to take over in our country. It reminds me of a time where everything used to be so simple and I also want to help in preserving that memory and culture.</p>
